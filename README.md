# Limbus Company Data Analysis Projects

A collection of scripts written to analyze game data from the mobile game Limbus Company.

These projects were written using and require at least Node v18.16.1. Each project can be run from the command line with `node [script_name.js]`. You can find more information in the respective README files.

This repository does not contain the JSON files from the game used for the projects, as I was concerned about the legality of including those game files in this repo. You will need to rip the assets yourself or otherwise acquire them.

## Dataset Builder

A project for building a dataset of sinner IDs, skills, and passives for use in other projects. Go to the README [here](dataset_builder/README.md).
